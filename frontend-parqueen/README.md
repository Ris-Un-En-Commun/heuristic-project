# ParQueen Frontend

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the environment configuration file**  
   Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename the copy to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Start the application using Docker Compose**  
   Run the following command from the root of the project:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

This will start the frontend along with any required services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
